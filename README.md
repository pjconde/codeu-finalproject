### Application Description
This is our app for the CodeU final project. We are mainly focusing on using an android app for our UI. We decided to use the New York Times over wikipedia for populating our search results. The backend is implemented in Firebase for easier use in Android. Currently the search results are mainly articles in 2015 - 2016 which fall into the politics, government, or opinion sections of the New york Times. There are over 17,000 searchable articles.
